# Google OAuth Configuration Guide

## Overview
Your Firebase project is properly configured and ready for Google OAuth. Follow these steps to enable Google Sign-In.

## Current Configuration
- **Project ID**: `last-35eb7`
- **Auth Domain**: `last-35eb7.firebaseapp.com`
- **Codespace URL**: `https://fictional-space-guide-x556vjvrxwx53p4gp-3000.githubpreview.dev`

## Step 1: Enable Google Sign-In Provider

1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/last-35eb7/authentication/providers)
2. In the **Authentication** section, click on **Sign-in method**
3. Find **Google** in the list of providers
4. Click on **Google** to configure it
5. Toggle the **Enable** switch to ON
6. Add your **Project support email** (required for OAuth consent screen)
7. Click **Save**

## Step 2: Configure Authorized Domains

1. Go to [Authentication Settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/last-35eb7/authentication/settings)
2. Scroll down to **Authorized domains**
3. Add these domains:
   - `localhost` (for local development)
   - `fictional-space-guide-x556vjvrxwx53p4gp-3000.githubpreview.dev` (your Codespace)
   - `fictional-space-guide-x556vjvrxwx53p4gp-3000.app.github.dev` (alternative Codespace URL)

## Step 3: Test Google OAuth

After completing the above steps:

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the login page
3. Click the "Continue with Google" button
4. You should see the Google OAuth consent screen
5. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to your application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"This app isn't verified"**: This is normal for development. Click "Advanced" → "Go to [your-app] (unsafe)"

2. **"redirect_uri_mismatch"**: Make sure you've added all the authorized domains listed above

3. **"popup_blocked"**: The app will automatically fall back to redirect mode if popups are blocked

4. **"auth/unauthorized-domain"**: Add your domain to the authorized domains list

### Error Messages:
- If you see Firebase errors in console, they're likely due to missing Google provider configuration
- Most common: `auth/operation-not-allowed` means Google provider isn't enabled

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Firebase Configuration**: Complete and working
✅ **Google Auth Service**: Implemented with popup/redirect fallback
✅ **Auth Context Integration**: Google sign-in integrated with auth context
✅ **Cookie Management**: Proper session cookies set for middleware
✅ **UI Components**: Google sign-in button with proper styling

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Firebase Console configuration (Steps 1-2 above)
2. Test the Google sign-in functionality
3. Verify users are created in Firebase Authentication
4. Check that users can access the dashboard after Google sign-in

## Additional Features

Your current implementation includes:
- **Smart Fallback**: Automatically switches from popup to redirect if popups are blocked
- **Demo Mode Detection**: Disables Google sign-in in demo mode
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Session Management**: Proper cookie-based session management for middleware

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase Console settings match this guide
3. Ensure you're using the correct Codespace URL
4. Try clearing browser cache/cookies

**Note**: After enabling Google OAuth in Firebase Console, the sign-in should work immediately without any code changes needed.
