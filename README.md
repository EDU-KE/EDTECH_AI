## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

This project uses Genkit with the Google AI plugin. You need to obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:

```.env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

The AI features will not work without this key.

### 3. Running the Development Servers

**This is the most important step.** This project requires two development servers to run concurrently: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI flows. You must have both running for the AI features to work.

- **Terminal 1: Start the Next.js app:**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

- **Terminal 2: Start the Genkit AI server:**

  Open a new terminal window and run:
  ```bash
  npm run genkit:watch
  ```

  This starts the Genkit development UI, typically on `http://localhost:4000`, where you can inspect and test your AI flows. The `genkit:watch` command will also ensure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is loaded correctly.

## ü§î Troubleshooting

If the AI features are not working, follow these steps to diagnose the issue:

1.  **Check Your API Key**: Ensure your `.env` file exists in the project root and contains the line `GOOGLE_API_KEY=...` with your actual key. An invalid or missing key is the most common problem.

2.  **Verify Both Servers Are Running**: Make sure you have two separate terminal windows open. One should be running `npm run dev` (for the website) and the other `npm run genkit:watch` (for the AI). If either one has crashed, the AI features will fail.

3.  **Use the Genkit Developer UI**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4000`. This is the Genkit UI.
    *   You should see a list of all the AI "Flows" (e.g., `provideAiTutoring`, `generateClassNotes`).
    *   Click on any flow, enter some test data in the "Input" JSON field, and click "Run".
    *   If you see a successful "Output" on this page, the AI is working! The problem is likely in the connection with the Next.js app.
    *   If you see an error here (especially an "Authentication" or "API key" error), it confirms the issue is with your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment using [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting).

### 1. Firebase Setup

1.  If you don't have one, create a Firebase project at the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Install the Firebase CLI if you haven't already: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
3.  Log in to your Google account: `firebase login`
4.  Initialize App Hosting in your project directory: `firebase init apphosting`

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

For the AI features to work in the deployed environment, you must set your Google API key as a secret. This only needs to be done once.

```bash
firebase apphosting:secrets:set GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

When prompted, paste the API key you obtained from Google AI Studio.

### 3. Deploy

Deploy your application to Firebase App Hosting:

```bash
firebase apphosting:backends:deploy
```

The `apphosting.yaml` file in the root of the project is used to configure the deployment settings. The default settings are suitable for getting started.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `src/app/`: Contains all the pages of the application, following the Next.js App Router structure.
- `src/components/`: Shared React components used across the application, including UI components from ShadCN.
- `src/ai/`:
  - `genkit.ts`: Genkit configuration file.
  - `flows/`: All Genkit AI flows are defined here. Each file typically represents a specific AI capability (e.g., `summarize-notes.ts`).
- `src/lib/`:
  - `actions.ts`: Server Actions that connect the frontend components to the backend AI flows.
  - `mock-data.ts`: Contains mock data used throughout the application for demonstration purposes.
  - `utils.ts`: Utility functions.
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.

## ü§ñ AI Features Overview

The platform's intelligence is powered by several Genkit flows:

- `provideAiTutoring`: Answers student questions on a given subject.
- `generatePersonalizedLearningPath`: Creates a custom study schedule.
- `generateRecommendations`: Finds and suggests learning resources.
- `summarizeNotes`: Condenses long text into key points.
- `generateClassNotes`: Creates new notes from a topic.
- `generateLessonPlan` & `generateSchemeOfWork`: Assists tutors with curriculum planning.
- `generateExamQuestions`: Creates practice exam questions.
- `explainExam`: Analyzes an exam's structure and topics.
- `generateStudyTips`: Provides subject-specific study advice.
- `generateProgressInsights`: Analyzes a student's progress and provides feedback.
