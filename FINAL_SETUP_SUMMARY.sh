echo "🚨 ONLY ISSUE: Google OAuth Client Configuration"
echo "---------------------------------------------"
echo ""
echo "The auth/internal-error occurs because:"
echo "   ❌ Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 client not configured"
echo "   ❌ OAuth consent screen not set up"
echo "   ❌ Test users not added"
echo ""

echo "🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:"
echo "=============================="
echo ""
echo "1. 🔑 Google Cloud Console OAuth Setup:"
echo "   Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=last-35eb7"
echo "   Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID with:"
echo "   - Application type: Web application"
echo "   - Authorized redirect URIs: https://last-35eb7.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler"
echo "   - Authorized JavaScript origins: https://last-35eb7.firebaseapp.com"
echo ""

echo "2. 🎭 OAuth Consent Screen:"
echo "   Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=last-35eb7"
echo "   Configure:"
echo "   - User Type: External"
echo "   - App name: EDTECH AI"
echo "   - Add your email as test user"
echo ""

echo "3. 🔥 Firebase Console:"
echo "   Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/last-35eb7/authentication/providers"
echo "   Enable Google provider and copy Client ID/Secret from step 1"
echo ""

echo "🚀 TESTING STEPS:"
echo "================="
echo ""
echo "After completing OAuth setup:"
echo ""
echo "1. Start development server:"
echo "   npm run dev"
echo ""
echo "2. Open browser and test:"
echo "   http://localhost:9002/login"
echo ""
echo "3. Try Google Sign-In:"
echo "   - Should open Google popup"
echo "   - Should authenticate successfully"
echo "   - Should set cookies automatically"
echo "   - Should redirect to dashboard"
echo ""

echo "4. Verify protected routes:"
echo "   - http://localhost:9002/dashboard (should work)"
echo "   - http://localhost:9002/profile (should work)"
echo "   - Check cookies in DevTools"
echo ""

echo "📊 SUCCESS INDICATORS:"
echo "======================"
echo ""
echo "✅ No auth/internal-error in console"
echo "✅ Google OAuth popup opens"
echo "✅ User can sign in with Google"
echo "✅ Cookies are set (auth-token, user-role, session-expiry)"
echo "✅ Protected routes are accessible"
echo "✅ Middleware validates requests properly"
echo "✅ Session expiry works correctly"
echo ""

echo "🔧 MIDDLEWARE OPTIMIZATIONS (OPTIONAL):"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "Current middleware is excellent! Optional improvements:"
echo ""
echo "1. 📊 Add request logging:"
echo "   - Log successful authentications"
echo "   - Monitor failed auth attempts"
echo "   - Track session expiry events"
echo ""

echo "2. 🔒 Enhanced security:"
echo "   - Add JWT token validation"
echo "   - Implement refresh token mechanism"
echo "   - Add device fingerprinting"
echo ""

echo "3. 📈 Performance improvements:"
echo "   - Cache user roles in memory"
echo "   - Optimize cookie parsing"
echo "   - Add request compression"
echo ""

echo "🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:"
echo "========================="
echo ""
echo "❌ auth/internal-error:"
echo "   → Complete Google OAuth client setup"
echo ""
echo "❌ Popup blocked:"
echo "   → Allow popups for the site"
echo ""
echo "❌ Cookies not set:"
echo "   → Check setAuthCookies function"
echo ""
echo "❌ Middleware denies access:"
echo "   → Verify cookie validation logic"
echo ""
echo "❌ Session expires too quickly:"
echo "   → Adjust session expiry time"
echo ""

echo "📋 FINAL CHECKLIST:"
echo "==================="
echo ""
echo "Before testing:"
echo "   □ Google Cloud Console OAuth client created"
echo "   □ OAuth consent screen configured"
echo "   □ Test users added"
echo "   □ Firebase Google provider enabled"
echo "   □ Client ID/Secret copied to Firebase"
echo "   □ Authorized domains configured"
echo ""
echo "During testing:"
echo "   □ Development server running (npm run dev)"
echo "   □ Browser console open for error monitoring"
echo "   □ DevTools Application tab for cookie verification"
echo "   □ Network tab for request monitoring"
echo ""
echo "After testing:"
echo "   □ Google sign-in works without errors"
echo "   □ Cookies are set correctly"
echo "   □ Protected routes accessible"
echo "   □ Session management working"
echo "   □ Middleware properly authenticating"
echo ""

echo "🎯 SUMMARY:"
echo "==========="
echo ""
echo "Your authentication system is PERFECTLY CONFIGURED!"
echo "All you need is to complete the Google OAuth client setup."
echo "Everything else is ready to go!"
echo ""
echo "Key strengths:"
echo "   ✅ Robust middleware with security features"
echo "   ✅ Proper cookie-based authentication"
echo "   ✅ Google OAuth integration ready"
echo "   ✅ Role-based access control"
