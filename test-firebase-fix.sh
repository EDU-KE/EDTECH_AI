echo "🔧 FIREBASE INITIALIZATION FIX APPLIED"
echo "======================================"

echo ""
echo "✅ Fixed Firebase initialization issues:"
echo "   - Added proper error handling for Firebase Auth initialization"
echo "   - Enhanced logging for debugging"
echo "   - Added Firebase Auth status checks in Google OAuth"
echo "   - Improved error messages and diagnostics"
echo ""

echo "🔍 What was fixed:"
echo "   1. Firebase Auth initialization now has proper error handling"
echo "   2. Added checks to ensure Firebase Auth is ready before Google OAuth"
echo "   3. Enhanced logging to identify initialization problems"
echo "   4. Better error messages for debugging"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Testing the fix:"
echo "   1. Start the development server"
echo "   2. Check browser console for Firebase initialization logs"
echo "   3. Try Google Sign-In"
echo "   4. Monitor for auth/internal-error"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Starting test server..."
npm run dev &
SERVER_PID=$!

echo "   Server PID: $SERVER_PID"
echo "   Waiting for initialization..."
sleep 5

echo ""
echo "📊 Testing Instructions:"
echo "========================"
echo ""

echo "1. 🌐 Open browser and navigate to:"
echo "   http://localhost:9002/login"
echo ""

echo "2. 🔍 Open Browser DevTools (F12) and check Console tab for:"
echo "   - '🔥 Firebase App initialized successfully'"
echo "   - '🔐 Firebase Auth initialized successfully'"
echo "   - '📊 Firestore initialized successfully'"
echo "   - '🔥 Firebase Configuration Status'"
echo "   - '🔐 Firebase Auth Status'"
echo ""

echo "3. 🎯 Try Google Sign-In and monitor console for:"
echo "   - '🔄 Starting Google sign-in with popup...'"
echo "   - '🔐 Firebase Auth status' log with auth details"
echo "   - Should NOT see 'auth/internal-error'"
echo ""

echo "4. ✅ Expected Success Behavior:"
echo "   - Firebase initialization logs appear"
echo "   - Google popup opens successfully"
echo "   - No auth/internal-error"
echo "   - Authentication completes"
echo ""

echo "5. 🚨 If you still see auth/internal-error:"
echo "   - Check the detailed Firebase Auth status logs"
echo "   - Look for any Firebase initialization errors"
echo "   - Verify all Firebase config values are correct"
echo ""

echo "📋 Key Changes Made:"
echo "===================="
echo ""

echo "✅ Firebase Auth initialization:"
echo "   - Added try-catch around auth initialization"
echo "   - Enhanced error logging"
echo "   - Added success confirmation logs"
echo ""

echo "✅ Google OAuth service:"
echo "   - Added Firebase Auth readiness check"
echo "   - Enhanced status logging"
echo "   - Better error handling"
echo ""

echo "✅ Configuration status:"
echo "   - Detailed Firebase status logging"
echo "   - Auth instance verification"
echo "   - App initialization confirmation"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Most Likely Result:"
echo "======================"
echo ""

echo "The auth/internal-error should now be resolved!"
echo "If Firebase is properly configured, Google OAuth will work."
echo ""

echo "If you still see issues, the console logs will now show"
echo "exactly what's failing in the Firebase initialization."
echo ""

echo "💡 Pro Tip:"
echo "The enhanced logging will help identify any remaining"
echo "configuration issues. Look for the Firebase status logs"
echo "in the browser console."
echo ""

echo "🔧 Server is running at: http://localhost:9002"
echo "📊 Check the browser console for detailed Firebase logs"
echo ""

echo "Press Enter to stop the server..."
read -r

kill $SERVER_PID
echo "✅ Server stopped"
echo ""

echo "📞 Next Steps:"
echo "   1. Check if Firebase initialization logs appeared"
echo "   2. Test Google Sign-In"
echo "   3. Report any remaining errors with the detailed logs"
