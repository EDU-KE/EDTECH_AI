echo "---------------------"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Current Middleware Features:"
echo "   - Cookie-based authentication (compatible with Google OAuth)"
echo "   - Security validation (XSS, SQL injection, path traversal)"
echo "   - Rate limiting (120 req/min)"
echo "   - Role-based access control"
echo "   - Demo mode support"
echo "   - Session management"
echo "   - Security headers"
echo ""

echo "üîç MIDDLEWARE AUTH FLOW:"
echo "   1. User signs in with Google ‚Üí Firebase Auth"
echo "   2. Auth context (auth-context.tsx) sets cookies:"
echo "      - auth-token: firebase-token-{uid}"
echo "      - user-role: student|teacher|admin"
echo "      - session-expiry: timestamp"
echo "   3. Middleware checks these cookies on each request"
echo "   4. Protected routes require valid cookies"
echo "   5. Expired sessions redirect to login"
echo ""

echo "üö® POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH GOOGLE OAUTH:"
echo "   1. Cookie setting timing (must happen after Google sign-in)"
echo "   2. Session expiry handling"
echo "   3. Role assignment for Google users"
echo "   4. Demo mode interference"
echo ""

echo "üîß OPTIMIZATION CHECKS:"
echo "   1. Verify cookie setting in signInWithGoogle function"
echo "   2. Ensure proper session expiry handling"
echo "   3. Check demo mode detection"
echo "   4. Validate role assignment for Google users"

echo "üîß RECOMMENDED OPTIMIZATIONS:"
echo ""

echo "1. üç™ Cookie Setting Enhancement:"
echo "   - Ensure cookies are set immediately after Google sign-in"
echo "   - Add proper expiration times"
echo "   - Include secure flags for production"
echo ""

echo "2. üïê Session Management:"
echo "   - Implement proper session refresh"
echo "   - Add session validation on critical operations"
echo "   - Handle session expiry gracefully"
echo ""

echo "3. üë§ Role Assignment:"
echo "   - Default Google users to 'student' role"
echo "   - Allow role upgrade through admin interface"
echo "   - Store role in Firestore for persistence"
echo ""

echo "4. üîí Security Enhancements:"
echo "   - Add CSRF protection for auth operations"
echo "   - Implement secure cookie flags"
echo "   - Add additional JWT validation"
echo ""

echo "üìã TESTING CHECKLIST:"
echo "   - [ ] Google sign-in sets auth-token cookie"
echo "   - [ ] Middleware recognizes authenticated user"
echo "   - [ ] Protected routes are accessible after Google sign-in"
echo "   - [ ] Session expires correctly"
echo "   - [ ] Role-based access works"
echo "   - [ ] Demo mode doesn't interfere"
echo ""

echo "üö® COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:"
echo ""

echo "Issue 1: Google sign-in success but middleware denies access"
echo "Solution: Check if setAuthCookies is called after Google sign-in"
echo ""

echo "Issue 2: auth/internal-error during Google sign-in"
echo "Solution: Complete Google Cloud Console OAuth configuration"
echo ""

echo "Issue 3: Middleware redirects to login after Google sign-in"
echo "Solution: Verify cookie domain and path settings"
echo ""

echo "Issue 4: Role-based access not working for Google users"
echo "Solution: Ensure role is properly assigned and stored"
echo ""

echo "üîß IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:"
echo "1. Complete Google OAuth setup (run ./complete-oauth-setup.sh)"
echo "2. Test authentication flow"
echo "3. Verify cookie setting in browser DevTools"
echo "4. Check middleware logs for auth validation"
echo ""

echo "üìä MONITORING:"
echo "   - Check browser console for auth errors"
echo "   - Monitor Network tab for failed requests"
echo "   - Verify cookies in Application tab"
echo "   - Check server logs for middleware issues"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS:"
echo "   - Google sign-in works without errors"
echo "   - Cookies are set correctly"
echo "   - Protected routes accessible"
echo "   - Session management works"
echo "   - Role-based access functions"
