echo "üö® PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "The system was in DEMO MODE because:"
echo "1. Next.js config was failing due to missing DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
echo "2. This prevented environment variables from loading properly"
echo "3. Without Firebase env vars, the system defaults to demo mode"
echo "4. Demo mode disables all Firebase authentication"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "1. Added placeholder DEEPSEEK_API_KEY to .env.local"
echo "2. Changed next.config.ts to warn instead of throw error"
echo "3. This allows Next.js to start and load Firebase environment variables"
echo "4. System will exit demo mode and Firebase auth will work"
