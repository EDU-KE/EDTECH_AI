echo "‚ñ° Authorized JavaScript origins include:"
echo "   - https://last-35eb7.firebaseapp.com"
echo "   - http://localhost:9002"
echo "‚ñ° Authorized redirect URIs include:"
echo "   - https://last-35eb7.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler"
echo "   - http://localhost:9002/__/auth/handler"

echo "üö® MOST COMMON ISSUE:"
echo "===================="
echo ""

echo "Based on auth/internal-error, the issue is likely:"
echo "‚ùå OAuth 2.0 Client ID doesn't exist OR"
echo "‚ùå Redirect URIs are missing OR"
echo "‚ùå Test user not added OR"
echo "‚ùå Client ID mismatch between Google Cloud and Firebase"
echo ""

echo "üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION:"
echo "==================="
echo ""

echo "1. First, verify OAuth client exists:"
echo "   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=last-35eb7"
echo ""

echo "2. If it exists, check redirect URIs include:"
echo "   https://last-35eb7.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler"
echo ""

echo "3. If missing, add the redirect URI and save"
echo ""

echo "4. Verify you're added as test user:"
echo "   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=last-35eb7"
echo ""

echo "5. Test again: npm run dev ‚Üí http://localhost:9002/login"
echo ""

echo "üìû WHAT TO CHECK RIGHT NOW:"
echo "==========================="
echo ""

echo "Please verify:"
echo "1. Does OAuth 2.0 Client ID exist in Google Cloud Console?"
echo "2. Are the redirect URIs configured correctly?"
echo "3. Is your email added as test user?"
echo "4. Does the Client ID match between Google Cloud and Firebase?"
echo ""

echo "üéâ RESULT:"
echo "=========="
echo ""

echo "Once you fix the OAuth client configuration,"
echo "the auth/internal-error will disappear immediately!"
echo ""

echo "The most common fix is adding the redirect URI:"
echo "https://last-35eb7.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler"
