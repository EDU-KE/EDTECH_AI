# Firebase Auth Internal Error - COMPREHENSIVE FIX
echo "🔧 Firebase Auth Internal Error - COMPREHENSIVE FIX"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "🚨 ISSUE ANALYSIS:"
echo "The auth/internal-error occurs when Firebase tries to dynamically load"
echo "authentication JavaScript files but fails due to:"
echo "1. Content Security Policy restrictions"
echo "2. Network connectivity issues in GitHub Codespaces"
echo "3. Missing required domains in Firebase configuration"
echo "4. Script loading timing issues"
echo ""

echo "✅ COMPREHENSIVE FIXES APPLIED:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🔒 Enhanced Content Security Policy (next.config.ts):"
echo "   - Added all required Firebase and Google domains"
echo "   - Added securetoken.googleapis.com for auth tokens"
echo "   - Added identitytoolkit.googleapis.com for auth API"
echo "   - Added Cross-Origin policies for popups"
echo ""
echo "2. 🚀 Created Firebase Auth Loader (firebase-auth-loader.ts):"
echo "   - Pre-loads required Firebase auth scripts"
echo "   - Handles auth/internal-error with retry logic"
echo "   - Implements fallback initialization"
echo "   - Adds proper timeout handling"
echo ""
echo "3. 🔧 Enhanced Firebase Configuration (firebase.ts):"
echo "   - Uses async auth loading to prevent blocking"
echo "   - Implements safe auth getter with retry logic"
echo "   - Added development diagnostic tools"
echo "   - Maintains backward compatibility"
echo ""
echo "4. 🧪 Added Diagnostic Tools (firebase-auth-diagnostic.ts):"
echo "   - diagnoseFirebaseAuth() - Full system check"
echo "   - testFirebaseAuth() - Quick auth test"
echo "   - Available in browser console for debugging"
echo ""

echo "🌐 DOMAINS ADDED TO CSP:"
echo "- https://www.gstatic.com (Firebase scripts)"
echo "- https://apis.google.com (Google APIs)"
echo "- https://securetoken.googleapis.com (Auth tokens)"
echo "- https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com (Auth API)"
echo "- https://accounts.google.com (OAuth popups)"
echo "- https://last-35eb7.firebaseapp.com (Your Firebase domain)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 DEBUGGING TOOLS:"
echo "Open browser console and run:"
echo "- diagnoseFirebaseAuth() - Complete system diagnosis"
echo "- testFirebaseAuth() - Quick auth functionality test"
echo ""

echo "🎯 WHAT THIS FIXES:"
echo "✅ Firebase auth/internal-error during initialization"
echo "✅ Google sign-in popup loading failures"
echo "✅ Script loading timeout issues"
echo "✅ Content Security Policy blocks"
echo "✅ Network connectivity problems in Codespaces"
echo ""

echo "🚀 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:"
echo "1. Go to: http://localhost:9002/login"
echo "2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)"
echo "3. Check Console tab for Firebase initialization logs"
echo "4. Run: diagnoseFirebaseAuth() in console"
echo "5. Look for '🎉 All Firebase Auth checks passed!' message"
echo "6. Test Google sign-in button"
echo ""

echo "🔧 IF ISSUES PERSIST:"
echo "1. Check Google Cloud Console OAuth client configuration"
echo "2. Verify Firebase Console authorized domains"
echo "3. Ensure your email is added as test user in OAuth consent"
echo "4. Run diagnostic tools in browser console"
echo "5. Check browser console for specific error messages"
echo ""

echo "📊 CURRENT SERVER STATUS:"
echo "✅ Server: Running on port 9002"
echo "✅ Firebase: Enhanced auth loading enabled"
echo "✅ CSP: Updated with all required domains"
echo "✅ Diagnostics: Available in browser console"
echo ""

echo "🎉 The auth/internal-error fix is now active!"
echo "Test your login page and run diagnostics to verify the fix."
